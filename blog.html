                    <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">How I Got My First Software Testing Job</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #64748b; margin-bottom: 1rem;">January 2026</p>
                    <p>Getting your first software testing job can feel impossible when you have no experience. I was in the same position two years ago. Here's the exact roadmap I followed.</p>
                    <p>First, I learned the fundamentals: test design techniques like boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning, how to read requirements, and how to write clear bug reports. I practiced these skills on open-source projects and created sample test documentation.</p>
                    <p>Then I built my first automation project using Selenium and Java, which I showcased on GitHub. This single project opened doors because it showed I could learn tools beyond manual testing.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I prepared for interviews by practicing common QA questions and working through real bug scenarios. Within three months, I landed my first QA role.</p>

                    <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Building Your First Website with GitHub Pages</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #64748b; margin-bottom: 1rem;">November 2025</p>
                    <p>GitHub Pages lets you host static websites completely free. This is perfect for creating your portfolio, documenting projects, or starting a tech blog.</p>
                    <p>Step 1: Create a repository named username.github.io (replace username with your GitHub username). This special naming convention tells GitHub you want to host a website.</p>
                    <p>Step 2: Add your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the repository. Your index.html file will be the homepage.</p>
                    <p>Step 3: Push your code to GitHub. Within a few minutes, your site will be live at https://username.github.io.</p>
                    <p>You can also add a custom domain like I did with rsgh.online by configuring DNS settings in your domain registrar and adding a CNAME file to your repository.</p>

                    <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">2026: How Smart Testers Should Focus Their Learning</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #64748b; margin-bottom: 1rem;">December 2025</p>
                    <p>Testing in 2026 is not just about executing manual test cases. Smart testers focus on a clear stack: strong fundamentals, one UI automation framework, one API tool, and practical CI/CD skills.</p>
                    <p>Start by strengthening your basics: test design techniques, reading requirements, and writing clear bug reports. Then pick one UI automation tool such as Selenium or Playwright, and one API tool like Postman or REST Assured, and practice them on real applications.</p>
                    <p>Next, connect your tests to CI/CD using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Azure DevOps so that every commit can trigger automated checks. Finally, explore AI-assisted tools that help generate tests, analyze logs, and prioritize scenarios, so you become the engineer who uses AI to deliver quality faster.</p>

                    <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">From Manual to AI-Powered Testing: A Practical 2026 Plan</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #64748b; margin-bottom: 1rem;">December 2025</p>
                    <p>If you are a manual tester in 2026, you do not need to panic about AI. Instead, you need a simple roadmap to move from pure manual work to automation and AI-powered testing step by step.</p>
                    <p>Phase 1 is to automate repeatable regression flows using tools like Selenium, Cypress, or Playwright, and to cover your most critical APIs with automated checks. This immediately frees your time to focus on exploratory testing and risk-based scenarios.</p>
                    <p>Phase 2 is to add AI tools that can suggest test ideas, generate test data, group failures, and highlight risky areas in the application. Combine your domain knowledge with these tools, and you become a high-value SDET who understands both the product and modern testing technology.</p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">LinkedIn Profile Optimization for QA Engineers</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #64748b; margin-bottom: 1rem;">January 2026</p>
                <p>Your LinkedIn profile is your digital first impression for recruiters. As a QA engineer, optimizing your profile can significantly increase your visibility and job opportunities.</p>
                <p>Start with a strong headline that goes beyond just your job title. Instead of "Software Test Engineer," try "QA Automation Engineer | Selenium | API Testing | CI/CD" to showcase your key skills immediately.</p>
                <p>In your summary, tell your testing story. Explain what drives you about quality, mention specific tools and frameworks you work with, and include measurable achievements like "reduced regression testing time by 60%" or "increased test coverage from 45% to 85%."</p>
                <p>Add a featured section to showcase your GitHub projects, testing blogs, or certifications. This makes your profile stand out and proves your practical skills beyond what's listed in your experience section.</p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Building a QA Portfolio That Gets You Hired</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #64748b; margin-bottom: 1rem;">January 2026</p>
                <p>Most QA engineers make the mistake of listing experience without proof. A portfolio showcases your actual testing skills through real projects and demonstrations.</p>
                <p>Create a GitHub repository with 3-5 automation projects covering different scenarios: a web UI test suite using Selenium or Playwright, API tests using REST Assured or Postman collections, and a mobile testing project with Appium.</p>
                <p>Document each project with clear README files explaining what you tested, your approach, tools used, and how to run the tests. Include test reports and screenshots showing your framework structure.</p>
                <p>Host a simple portfolio website (like this one using GitHub Pages) where you link to your projects, write about testing concepts you've learned, and share your resume. This single resource makes you memorable to recruiters.</p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">QA Interview Preparation: Questions You Must Know</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #64748b; margin-bottom: 1rem;">December 2025</p>
                <p>QA interviews test both your technical knowledge and problem-solving approach. Being prepared for common questions and scenarios makes all the difference.</p>
                <p>Technical questions will cover testing fundamentals (types of testing, SDLC models, defect lifecycle), automation frameworks (explain your preferred framework architecture, how you handle waits and synchronization), and practical coding (write test scripts for common scenarios like login validation or form submission).</p>
                <p>Behavioral questions focus on real situations: How do you prioritize testing when there's limited time? Describe a critical bug you found and how you reported it. How do you handle disagreements with developers about bug severity?</p>
                <p>Prepare 3-4 strong examples from your experience (or practice projects) that demonstrate your testing mindset, attention to detail, and communication skills. Use the STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result to structure your answers clearly.</p>
