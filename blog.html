            <h2>How I Got My First Software Testing Job</h2>
            <p class="post-meta">Career | January 2026</p>
            <p>Getting your first software testing job can feel impossible when you have no experience. I was in the same position two years ago. Here's the exact roadmap I followed.</p>
            <p>First, I learned the fundamentals: test design techniques like boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning, how to read requirements, and how to write clear bug reports. I practiced these skills on open-source projects and created sample test documentation.</p>
            <p>Then I built my first automation project using Selenium and Java, which I showcased on GitHub. This single project opened doors because it showed I could learn tools beyond manual testing.</p>
            <p>Finally, I prepared for interviews by practicing common QA questions and working through real bug scenarios. Within three months, I landed my first QA role.</p>

            <h2>5 Free Tools Every QA Engineer Should Know</h2>
            <p class="post-meta">Tutorial | December 2025</p>
            <p>You don't need expensive tools to become a great QA engineer. These five free tools cover everything from manual testing to automation and API testing.</p>
            <p><strong>1. Selenium WebDriver</strong> - The industry standard for web UI automation. Works with Java, Python, and JavaScript.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Postman</strong> - Perfect for API testing and creating automated API test suites. The free version has everything you need to start.</p>
            <p><strong>3. JMeter</strong> - Open-source performance testing tool from Apache. Great for load testing and stress testing your applications.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Playwright</strong> - Modern automation framework that supports multiple browsers and has excellent documentation.</p>
            <p><strong>5. TestNG / JUnit</strong> - Test frameworks that help you organize and run your automated tests with assertions and reporting.</p>

            <h2>Building Your First Website with GitHub Pages</h2>
            <p class="post-meta">Guide | November 2025</p>
            <p>GitHub Pages lets you host static websites completely free. This is perfect for creating your portfolio, documenting projects, or starting a tech blog.</p>
            <p>Step 1: Create a repository named username.github.io (replace username with your GitHub username). This special naming convention tells GitHub you want to host a website.</p>
            <p>Step 2: Add your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the repository. Your index.html file will be the homepage.</p>
            <p>Step 3: Push your code to GitHub. Within a few minutes, your site will be live at https://username.github.io.</p>
            <p>You can also add a custom domain like I did with rsgh.online by configuring DNS settings in your domain registrar and adding a CNAME file to your repository.</p>

            <h2>2026: How Smart Testers Should Focus Their Learning</h2>
            <p class="post-meta">Career | December 2025</p>
            <p>Testing in 2026 is not just about executing manual test cases. Smart testers focus on a clear stack: strong fundamentals, one UI automation framework, one API tool, and practical CI/CD skills.</p>
            <p>Start by strengthening your basics: test design techniques, reading requirements, and writing clear bug reports. Then pick one UI automation tool such as Selenium or Playwright, and one API tool like Postman or REST Assured, and practice them on real applications.</p>
            <p>Next, connect your tests to CI/CD using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Azure DevOps so that every commit can trigger automated checks. Finally, explore AI-assisted tools that help generate tests, analyze logs, and prioritize scenarios, so you become the engineer who uses AI to deliver quality faster.</p>

            <h2>From Manual to AI-Powered Testing: A Practical 2026 Plan</h2>
            <p class="post-meta">Guide | December 2025</p>
            <p>If you are a manual tester in 2026, you do not need to panic about AI. Instead, you need a simple roadmap to move from pure manual work to automation and AI-powered testing step by step.</p>
            <p>Phase 1 is to automate repeatable regression flows using tools like Selenium, Cypress, or Playwright, and to cover your most critical APIs with automated checks. This immediately frees your time to focus on exploratory testing and risk-based scenarios.</p>
            <p>Phase 2 is to add AI tools that can suggest test ideas, generate test data, group failures, and highlight risky areas in the application. Combine your domain knowledge with these tools, and you become a high-value SDET who understands both the product and modern testing technology.</p>
